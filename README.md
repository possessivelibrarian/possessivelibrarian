- 👋 Hi, I’m @possessivelibrarian
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development and learning to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript through an online course. :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mentoring so I have a partner to learn from and if open, quiz me sometimes while I try to build my own website from scratch.
- 📫 How to reach me: here on github will be easiest and then we can work on collaborating through discord or some other means.
